## Python - 100 days from novice to master

> Author: Luo Hao
>
> Description: Recently, many friends who want to learn Python apply to add me to WeChat and QQ separately, because I am usually very busy, I can't answer everyone's questions one by one, I created **Python 100 days learning exchange 2 groups** And **Python 100 days to learn to communicate 4 groups ** two exchange groups, group number is **213132758** and **661325483**, the QR code is below (recommended to add 4 groups, because 2 groups are about to be full ). My colleagues and friends are also in this group. They are all excellent Python developers, have rich experience in commercial projects, we will answer your questions in time when there is enough time, and from Python language entry to Web application development. From data analysis to machine learning, there are technical experts in every field to answer questions. In the future, we will try to do a live video broadcast every week to share the development of Python in the form of special topics. At the same time, we will hold online and offline technical exchanges and sharing activities from time to time, and small partners can exchange groups. Thanks to ** Qianfeng Education Python Teaching Department** for support of this group.

     > Supplement: Agile Software Development Manifesto
     >
     > - **Individual and interactive** Higher than processes and tools
     > - **Working software** is higher than detailed documentation
     > - **Customer cooperation** Higher than contract negotiation
     > - **Response changes** Higher than following plan

     ![](./res/agile-scrum-sprint-cycle.png)

     > Role: Product owner (who decides what to do, who can make a decision), team leader (solve various issues, focus on how to work better, shield external influence on development team), development team (project executive) , specifically for developers and testers).

     > Preparation: Business case and funding, contract, defects, initial product requirements, initial release plan, shareholding, formation team.

     > Agile teams typically have 8-10 people.

     > Workload Estimation: Quantify development tasks, including prototype, logo design, UI design, front-end development, etc., try to decompose each work into a minimum task, the minimum task size is not more than two days, and then estimate the overall project. time. Paste each task on the whiteboard. The whiteboard is divided into three parts: to do (to be completed), in progress (in progress), and done (completed).

     - For simple applications that don't require a lot of customization, Gunicorn is a good choice. The learning curve of uWSGI is much steeper than Gunicorn. Gunicorn's default parameters are already adaptable to most applications.
     - uWSGI supports heterogeneous deployments.
     - Since Nginx itself supports uWSGI, Nginx and uWSGI are generally bundled together online, and uWSGI is a full-featured and highly customized WSGI middleware.
     - In terms of performance, Gunicorn and uWSGI actually perform quite the same.
